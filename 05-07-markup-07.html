  <p>We just released <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> 7.2.0 and <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/main.css">main.css</a> 2.0.0. Even with the major release number on main.css, both of these are basically maintenance releases. Open Source isn't always about the big stuff. </p>
  
  <p>We also did a bunch of clean-up around the related H5BP projects, with updates to <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5boilerplate.com">HTML5Boilerplate.com</a> and <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/h5bp.github.io">h5bp.org</a>. We integrated main.css as a direct dependency on both projects and did some other clean-up. </p>
